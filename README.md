# ec601 Mini Project 3
## Introduction of React Native
React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook. It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS and Web. React Native is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces and page applications, and allows us to create reusable UI components.

### Pons
React Native enables a single JavaScript codebase for 2 different platforms. This means that it is not just easier to maintain the app by having the same development process for both platforms and reusing the same code, but it also requires less resources, because there is no need for separate iOS and Android teams.
### Cons
It is well-known that Android and iOS have different design guidelines, so if the project requirements dictate that these specific OS requirements should be followed for each native platform, React Native developer will need to write platform-specific code, which defeats the purpose of the single codebase.

## Introduction of Android
IOS (formerly iPhone OS) is a mobile operating system created and developed by Apple Inc. Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones.

### Pros
The main programming language for Android is Java, and the bytecode in Android runs on the Dalvik virtual machine.Therefore, Java programs running on the Dalvik virtual machine are faster than Java programs running on the traditional JVM.
### Cons
The activity file and .xml files seperately define the functions and styles of an Andriod applivation, so it may cost more effort to build the entire system compared to React Native.


## Demo
For this mini project, a simple Tic Tac Toe Web game is designed using React. Two players can play the game by turns. The demo result is shown in the result folder.
